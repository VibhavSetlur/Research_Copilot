# Contributing to Research OS

Thanks for being interested. Research OS is small on purpose — only
contribute changes that keep the surface small and the protocols sharp.

## Architecture in one paragraph

The AI IDE is the brain (Cursor / Claude / Antigravity / OpenCode /
VS Code / Windsurf / Continue / Aider). Research OS is the body: 94 MCP
tools and 47 YAML protocols, plus a router that turns a user prompt into
a protocol pick + planned tool sequence without loading every YAML. It
enforces immutability (`inputs/raw_data/`, `inputs/literature/`) and
provenance (`workspace/methods.md`, `workspace/analysis.md`,
`.os_state/protocol_execution_log.jsonl`, `.os_state/active_plan.json`).
It never calls an LLM itself.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VibhavSetlur/Research-OS.git
cd Research-OS
pip install -e ".[ci,dev]"           # lean install used by CI
# or pip install -e ".[all,dev]"     # everything except R / Julia / Docker
pytest                                # ~180 tests, ~3s
ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/
python scripts/preflight.py           # 12 wiring checks
```

## Adding or modifying a protocol

Each protocol lives at `src/research_os/protocols/<category>/<name>.yaml`.
Keep the schema tight:

```yaml
id: <protocol_id>
name: <Human Name>
version: '5.0.0'
schema_version: '2.0'
description: One-line summary.
trigger: When the AI should run this.
prerequisites:
  - state field or file
steps:
  - id: step_id
    name: Step Name
    description: |
      Concrete tool calls (underscore form), one numbered action per step.
expected_outputs:
  - path/to/file
quality_bar: |
  Pass/fail bullets that gate completion.
next_protocol: category/next_one      # null if terminal
on_failure: guidance/dead_end_routing # null if no fallback
```

* The loader injects the standard `protocol_completion` step — do NOT add it.
* `next_protocol` must point at a real protocol or `null`. Verify no cycles.
* **REQUIRED**: add an entry for the new protocol to
  `src/research_os/protocols/_router_index.yaml` with `intent_class`,
  `sub_intent`, `summary`, and `triggers`. Preflight will fail if you
  forget. Optionally add `shortcut_tool`, `token_estimate`, and a
  `decomposition` list.
* Add to `PIPELINE` in `src/research_os/tools/actions/protocol.py` only
  if it's part of the main pipeline ordering.

## Adding a new tool

1. Implement the action in `src/research_os/tools/actions/<category>/<file>.py`
   (state/, data/, exec/, search/, research/, audit/, synthesis/,
   memory/). Cross-cutting modules — `protocol.py` and `router.py` —
   live flat at `tools/actions/`. Return a dict with
   `status="success"|"error"` plus either `data` or `message`.
2. Add an entry to `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` in `src/research_os/server.py`
   with `short` (≤160 chars) + full `description` + `category` +
   `inputSchema`. Use underscore naming (`sys_X_Y`, `tool_X_Y`, `mem_X_Y`).
3. Add a handler `_handle_<name>(name, arguments, root)` and register it
   in the `_HANDLERS` dict at the bottom of `server.py`.
4. If the tool is something `tool_route` should know about, add it to
   `_router_index.yaml` either as a `decomposition` entry in an existing
   protocol or as a `shortcut_intents` entry.
5. If you're replacing an old tool name, add the alias to `_ALIASES`
   so older protocols keep working.
6. Reference the tool from at least one protocol or shortcut — orphaned
   tools become dead code and will be removed in the next cleanup.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/{unit,integration,tools}/`. Run a focused subset:

```bash
pytest tests/tools/test_router.py -v
pytest tests/unit/test_protocols.py::TestProtocolLoading
```

Add tests for any new tool's success + error paths in
`tests/tools/test_<area>.py`. Router or protocol changes should ship
with at least one test that exercises the new behaviour end-to-end.

## Style

* Ruff defaults; line length 100.
* Type hints required on new functions.
* One short module docstring at the top of every new file.
* No emojis in source or markdown unless an existing convention requires it.
* No backwards-compat shims for code that hasn't shipped. We're at 1.0.0;
  breaking internal refactors are OK as long as the MCP surface
  (`_HANDLERS` keys + JSON schemas) stays stable or has aliases.

## Reporting issues

Use the GitHub issue templates. Include the version
(`pip show research-os`), the OS, the steps to reproduce, the full
traceback, and any relevant log excerpt from `workspace/logs/`.
