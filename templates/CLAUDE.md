# Research OS workspace — Claude Code

This is a Research OS workspace. **Read `AGENTS.md` at the project root
first** — it contains the canonical operating rules.

Every session boots in **two MCP calls + hierarchical routing**:

1. `sys_boot` — one call returns project state + researcher config +
   protocol history + dep inventory + recommended next protocol +
   pause classification + any active plan. Do NOT call the individual
   `sys_state_get` / `sys_config_get` / `sys_protocol_next` /
   `sys_dep_inventory` / `sys_protocol_history` calls separately.
2. After the researcher's first message, call
   `tool_route(prompt=<their message>)`. It picks the right protocol via
   a hierarchical L1 (`intent_class`) → L2 (`sub_intent`) → L3 (protocol)
   walk. If `ask_user` is non-null, ASK that one-sentence question and
   re-route — never guess.
3. For `complexity: high`, the router persisted an `active_plan`.
   Call `tool_plan_turn` to get the batch sized to your `model_profile`
   (small=1, medium=3, large=6 steps per turn, weighted for heavy tools).
   Execute every entry in `this_turn` IN ORDER. After each one, call
   `tool_plan_advance`. If `chat_split_recommended` is true, hand off
   and tell the researcher to open a fresh chat.
4. For `complexity: low`, call the shortcut tool directly OR load the
   primary protocol with `sys_protocol_get format='summary'` (~300
   tokens), then `format='step' + step_id='<id>'` when ready to execute.

Tools use underscores (`sys_state_get`, `tool_data_profile`,
`mem_analysis_log`). Dot notation and legacy names auto-rewrite. Need
the full description of a tool? `sys_tool_describe(tool_name)`.

Never write to `inputs/raw_data/` or `inputs/literature/` (immutable).
All workspace I/O goes through `sys_file_*` so provenance is captured.

Research OS does NOT manage LLM provider keys — Claude Code owns model
access. The only credentials Research OS uses are for literature / web
search providers (all optional).
