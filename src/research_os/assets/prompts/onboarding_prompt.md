# Onboarding Prompt

Welcome to Research OS.

When you first connect to a workspace, you must follow this onboarding sequence:
1. Call `sys.config.validate` to ensure you have the necessary API keys to operate.
2. If keys are missing, notify the user using `sys.notify` and ask them to update `inputs/researcher_config.yaml`.
3. Call `sys.state.summary` to understand the current experiment path and available data.
4. Call `sys.file.list` on `inputs/raw_data/` to see available datasets.
5. Do NOT modify any files in `inputs/`. All derived outputs should go to `workspace/`.
6. Read `AGENTS.md` in the repository root for detailed behavioral instructions.
