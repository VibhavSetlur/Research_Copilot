"""Red-team / hostile-reviewer scaffolding.

Produces a structured reviewer-style report against the project's own
paper. The AI fills it in by walking each claim against the workspace
outputs, the literature, and a fixed list of "devil's advocate"
questions. The scaffold mirrors the structure of a real journal
referee report so the output reads as a critique a reviewer would
actually write — not as a generic "any concerns?" sweep.

Sections produced
-----------------
* **Reviewer summary** — one paragraph in the reviewer's own words
  (proves the model read the paper).
* **Overall recommendation** — accept / minor revision / major
  revision / reject.
* **Major comments (M1, M2, ...)** — claim-by-claim challenges,
  ranked by severity. Each comment has: claim quoted from the paper,
  the concern, the evidence the concern rests on, the requested
  mitigation, line reference.
* **Minor comments (m1, m2, ...)** — small fixes, wording, missing
  references.
* **Threats to validity** — internal, external, construct,
  statistical conclusion validity, with one paragraph per dimension.
* **Devil's-advocate questions** — what would change my mind? What's
  the strongest opposing position? Which assumption fails first?

The output file is ``workspace/reviews/redteam_<iso>.md``. The model
that ran the audit is responsible for filling the headings with
concrete content; this module produces the SCAFFOLD plus an inventory
of materials the model should consult.
